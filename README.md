## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to make elements more responsive. 

### Continued development

I didn't use Grid in this project but, after watching Kevin Powell's video about this challenge, I can see how it could be applied. I will try to implement in my next project (if its use is warranted). I would also like to use data attributes instead of creating more class selectors. 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's submission to the challenge]([https://www.example.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8)) - i watched this video after my own attempt in order to identify what I could have done differently. It helped me find out about methods that could have prevented a few difficulties that I encountered during this project.
